Users will be able to get real-time weather information for the city they are searching through the built-in application. If users search for the wrong city, they are also shown an error notification stating that the requested city could not be located. We used the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides us with global weather data. For many areas, we have weather data that includes wind speed, among other things.
